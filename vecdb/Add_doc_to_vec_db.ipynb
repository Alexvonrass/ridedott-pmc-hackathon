There are options for boys who have not yet reached puberty. Those options are in a research setting. If your son is at risk of becoming infertile, you will have an interview with a fertility nurse specialist and a fertility doctor or urologist. If possible, this interview takes place before your son's treatment starts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe know that being able to father children is very important to many adult men who have had childhood cancer. So you will have an indepth consultation with a clinical nurse specialist and/or a doctor who specializes in fertility. The following matters are discussed during this consultation:\\n\\nThe effect of the treatment on your fertility;\\nThe options for preserving fertility.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nHow do your genital organs work?\\nYour testicles contain so-called leydig cells. They produce the male hormone testosterone. During puberty, testosterone causes your penis and scrotum to grow and you develop more body hair and muscles. After puberty, testosterone keeps your reproductive organ functioning and producing sperm. You also have sertoli cells. These cells ensure the development of the sperm cells. The leydig cells and sertoli cells are both important for your fertility. Your pituitary gland (small organ in the brain that produces hormones) also plays an important role with respect to fertility. It produces hormones that signal your testicles to make sperm cells and testosterone. When you ejaculate, semen comes out of your penis. Semen contains fluids and sperm cells.\\nDamage to your genitals\\nChemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can damage not only sperm cells, but also the cells that produce sperm and the pituitary gland that produces hormones. The result may be that you produce fewer sperm cells, that they are less mobile or that you no longer produce any sperm cells at all. You are then less fertile or sterile.\\nFertility preservation\\nBefore your cancer treatment starts, we can freeze your sperm, that is, your sperm cells. You can use them later if you want to father a child. First, the clinical nurse specialist or doctor estimates what impact the treatment can have on your fertility.Should you need any further information, please feel free to ask.\\n\\n\\n\", 'filename': 'fertility-preservation-in-boys.txt'}, references=None, vector={}, collection='Instructions_collection'), Object(uuid=_WeaviateUUIDInt('cd387976-d45b-40bf-bf37-eb590ffea08a'), metadata=MetadataReturn(creation_time=None, last_update_time=None, distance=None, certainty=None, score=None, explain_score=None, is_consistent=None, rerank_score=None), properties={'content': \"intro: Every year, approximately 12-15 children in the Netherlands are diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the body.

Please note this brochure is currently only available in Dutch. The most important information is provided below.\\nCauses\\nGerm cell tumors are caused by a developmental error in one of the reproductive cells. Presumably, something has already changed in the cell's DNA in the nucleus before birth. The cause of that change is unknown. Germ cell tumors occur in the reproductive organs, but can also occur elsewhere.\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms depend on the location of the tumor. A tumor in the bottom region of the spinal column can cause visible swelling. If the tumor has grown inwardly, your child might suffer bladder and bowel dysfunction or they might have behavioral disorders. If a germ cell tumor occurs in the testicle, the scrotum is swollen; this is not very painful, if at all. A tumor in or near the ovary will eventually cause the abdomen to swell. The tumor can cause the ovary to rotate, which is very painful. In the event of a large tumor, the bladder and/or intestines can be flattened. Your child then has to urinate often and has difficulty defecating. The production of hormones can cause a child to enter early (precocious) puberty. A tumor in the chest can cause breathing problems.\\nHow is a germ cell tumor in the body diagnosed?\\nAn ultrasound and an MRI scan are performed and blood is drawn. Other scans can also be performed, as well as a biopsy in some instances.\\nTreatment\\nMost children are only required to have surgery, after which they are monitored by means of regular check-ups. If the tumor cannot be removed completely or if the tumor has metastasized, your child is given chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment. In the event of a large tumor, chemotherapy is usually the first course of treatment, followed by surgery, followed by a second course of chemotherapy. If the tumor comes back, surgery is usually performed again, followed by more chemotherapy.\\nChance of recovery\\nOn average, children with a germ cell tumor stand a 90% chance of recovery.\\xa0\\nQuestions?\\nChildren and adolescents with a germ cell tumor in their body are treated in the solid tumors department.\\n\\n\\n\", 'filename': 'germ-cell-tumors-in-the-body.txt'}, references=None, vector={}, collection='Instructions_collection'), Object(uuid=_WeaviateUUIDInt('a453218a-5173-4b88-8807-98885aa890aa'), metadata=MetadataReturn(creation_time=None, last_update_time=None, distance=None, certainty=None, score=None, explain_score=None, is_consistent=None, rerank_score=None), properties={'content': \"intro: Bone marrow is located in the central cavity of the bones.

Sometimes the bone marrow failure is already present at birth (congenital), sometimes it develops later in life (acquired).

If your child has a shortage of red blood cells (anaemia), your child is pale and tired, and can also suffer from dizziness and shortness of breath. A lack of healthy white blood cells can cause recurring or severe infections and fever. Nosebleeds, easy bruising, pinpoint-sized purple-red spots, and sores that keep bleeding are due to a shortage of platelets.

Please note this brochure is currently only available in Dutch. The most important information is provided below.\\nCauses\\nHLH is caused by a dysregulation of the immune system. The immune cells do not work properly and so, in an attempt to get the immune system back up, they divide uncontrollably. This causes an enormous secretion of inflammatory proteins. There are hereditary (primary) forms of HLH that often occur at a young age, but there are also secondary forms. The latter are a side effect of an infection, a rheumatological disease or cancer. The immune system has got out of control and is no longer properly regulated. The immune cells will continue to fuel HLH, particularly if the infection or the cancer is still present in the body.\\nSymptoms\\nChildren with HLH are often very sick, have a high fever that does not respond to antibiotics, swollen lymph nodes and a lack of healthy blood cells. Other symptoms include skin rash, an enlarged liver and spleen and sometimes neurological symptoms.\\nHow is HLH diagnosed?\\nThe symptoms and the results of a blood test combined are often sufficient to make the diagnosis. Treatment can then commence without delay and before your child gets any sicker. It is also checked whether heredity figures in your child's disease.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment consists of a combination of drugs that suppress inflammation (immunosuppression) and chemotherapy. A hereditary form of HLH requires a stem cell transplant with donor stem cells once the disease is stable.
