intro: Your daughter has been diagnosed with cancer. You have a lot to deal with and her fertility is probably the last thing on your mind. Nevertheless, it is important that you consider this early on, preferably before she starts on her treatment, because it can impact her fertility.
content:Ordinarily, our immune system destroys foreign and abnormal cells. But neuroblastoma cells are difficult for the immune system to recognize. Your child is therefore given dinutuximab, a GD-2 antibody (anti-GD2).Dinutuximab binds to GD-2, which sits on the surface of neuroblastoma cells. This sends a signal to the immune system that foreign cells have been identified. The immune system kicks in and destroys these foreign cells (the neuroblastoma cells).Dinutuximab treatment starts after high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation and continues for approximately six months. Part of the treatment can be administered at home.All information about this treatment can be found in the brochure Anti-GD2 immunotherapy (only in Dutch).
