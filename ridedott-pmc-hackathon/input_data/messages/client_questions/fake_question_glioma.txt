Could you please clarify the specific type of surgery that might be required for my child and what the recovery process will entail? Additionally, I am interested in learning more about the chemotherapy drugs, specifically Temozolomide and Bevacizumab, that were mentioned during our last consultation. What are the typical side effects we should prepare for with these treatments?

Lastly, given the aggressive nature of high-grade glioma, are there any clinical trials or newer treatments we should consider? How do we go about enrolling in such trials if available?
